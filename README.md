# Pulse-Oximeter With Arduino and MAX30100

The aim of this project is to create an automatic pulse-oximeter device for monitoring the SpO2 blood saturation and the heart rate using the MAX30100 Arduino module.

The output of the measurement is shown in a white 0.96 128x64 OLED display.

The application runs on an Arduino Nano v3.0 Atmega 328 card.
